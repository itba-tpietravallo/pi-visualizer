This allows for a clear separation between the interface and the implementation of the data structure.",

        "visualization-description": "Here you can visualize the behavior of some of the most common data structures. You can create new instances, perform operations on them and see how they change in real time.",
        "visualization-available-actions": "Some operations are available on all data structures, like Search. Others may see their behaviour altered (for example a List may `insert` but a Queue will only `insert-last`). The operations displayed on the menu will correspond to the selected data types",
        "mistakes-and-errors-note": "<important>Important</important>: This does not show all posible data types, their use, and combinations. The structures you'll be tested on may vary or include different fields and operations, <important>not showcased here</important>. This is merely a visual aid for the course, to help understand why we choose certain structures over others, and how they work.",
