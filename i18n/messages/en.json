This allows for a clear separation between the interface and the implementation of the data structure.",

        "visualization-available-actions": "Some operations are available on all data structures, like Search. Others may see their behaviour altered (for example a List may `insert` but a Queue will only `insert-last`). The operations displayed on the menu will correspond to the selected data types"
